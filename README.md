# Wall of Wish

This is my submission for the **Wall of Wish** challenge by Superteam UK and Chain Reaction.

With this app, anyone can connect their Phantom wallet, write a wish, and submit it. Once submitted, it sends a small transaction to the Solana Devnet and shows the transaction link. You can then check the transaction directly on the Solana Explorer.

## How it works

- Connect your wallet (Phantom)
- Type your wish in the input box
- Click “Submit Wish”
- It shows the transaction hash and links to Solana Explorer

## What I used

- React + Vite
- Solana Web3.js
- Phantom Wallet
- Solana Devnet

## Try it out

If it's hosted: [Insert your live link here]

Or run it locally:

1. Download or clone the repo
2. Open the folder
3. Run `npm install` then `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

## Made with love for Solana

I built this project to learn how Solana works and to be part of the Superteam community. Hope you like it!
